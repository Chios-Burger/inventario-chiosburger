# Fix for Missing Categoria and Tipo Fields in Historical Records

## Issue Description
Both the "Tipo A,B o C" field and the Category field are not showing in historical records. The investigation revealed that these fields are being captured from Airtable but are not being stored in the database.

## Root Cause
1. The database tables don't have columns for `categoria` and `tipo` fields
2. The server INSERT queries don't include these fields when saving inventory
3. The server SELECT queries don't retrieve these fields when fetching historical data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update
Created SQL script to add the missing columns to all inventory tables:
- File: `/sql/add_categoria_tipo_columns.sql`
- Run this script on your PostgreSQL database to add the `categoria` and `tipo` columns

### 2. Frontend Updates
Updated `src/services/historico.ts`:
- Added debug logging to verify categoria and tipo fields are coming from Airtable
- Updated `convertirDatosBD` function to include the `tipo` field when converting database records
- Added additional logging to track the data flow

### 3. Backend Updates
Updated `server/index.js`:
- Modified all INSERT queries to include `categoria` and `tipo` fields
- Modified all SELECT queries to retrieve `categoria` and `tipo` fields
- Added debug logging to track these fields during insert operations

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update Database Schema** (MUST BE DONE FIRST)
   ```bash
   # Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f sql/add_categoria_tipo_columns.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend Changes**
   - Deploy the updated `server/index.js` file
   - Restart the backend service

3. **Deploy Frontend Changes**
   - Build and deploy the frontend with the updated `src/services/historico.ts`

## Testing

1. Create a new inventory with products that have both Category and Tipo fields
2. Save the inventory
3. Check the historical records - both fields should now appear
4. For existing records, the fields will show as empty since they weren't captured before

## Notes

- Existing historical records won't have these fields populated (they will show as empty)
- Only new inventories created after this fix will have the categoria and tipo fields stored
- The tipo field supports multiple variations as defined in the types (e.g., "Tipo A,B o C", "Tipo A, B o C", etc.)

## Debug Information

If fields are still not showing:
1. Check browser console for debug logs starting with üîç
2. Verify the SQL script was executed successfully
3. Check that the backend is using the updated code
4. Verify Airtable is returning these fields (check console logs when loading products)
